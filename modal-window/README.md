## Modal Window

Flexed my tiny muscles on DOM manipulations, event handling, and CSS styling  with this project. 

### Description
This is a modal window implementation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It provides a way to display modal window or pop-up dialogs on a web page. The modal windows can be triggered by clicking on specific buttons and overlay the rest of the content on the page.

### Key Features
* Multiple buttons to trigger different modal windows.
* Each modal window contains a close button to dismiss it.
* The overlay creates a blurred background effect to draw attention to the modal window.
